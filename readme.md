# What can you find in this repository?
This repo includes small tasks and scripts that i have created. You can find Terraform tasks like creating  RDS with full environment  and Ansible playbooks.

## Terraform 
1. Create-postgres-rds on a private subnet 
2. Create-postgres-rds on a public subnet 

## Ansible 
1. Prometheus node exporter

## AWS
1. locate-orphaned-snapshots.py - This script will issue a list of all orphaned snapshots that can be found in your account. 
   Orphaned snapshots in AWS are EBS snapshots no longer linked to active volumes or instances, often created when volumes are deleted without removing their snapshots.
   These unused snapshots still incur storage costs. Regular audits and automated policies can help identify and delete them to save costs.
